- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @emily-rego
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in microbiology, gluten-free cooking, and improving my data analysis skills in R! 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on a fun project investigating the significance of a 'gluten-free' tax on baked goods and the cost of gluten-free certification of naturally gluten-free food.
